# Classification of Income: Parametric v.s. Nonparametric Models
This is the final project for Stat 527 lectured by Professor Noah Simon.
We have tested a total of 6 models to evaulate performance via AUC/ROC on a popular income dataset.

- The parametric models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes
- The nonparametric models: Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.
